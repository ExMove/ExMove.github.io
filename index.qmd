Welcome to the home page of ExMove. Here, you can find the resources to use our toolkit for processing biologging data from tag downloads to online archive.

Below is an overview of the workflow and what you can do with it:

#### How to access the resources:

-   [Read the manuscript, open access via Journal of Animal Ecology](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2656.14111) to find out why reproducible workflows are important, and for an overview of the tools available
-   [Access the GitHub repository](https://github.com/ExMove/ExMove) containing the code and documentation to run the toolkit
-   [Read the user guide](User_guide.html) for detailed instructions on how to apply the toolkit to your data
-   [View a worked example](Worked_example.html) of the toolkit applied to central-place foraging red-footed boobies, including identifying foraging trips
